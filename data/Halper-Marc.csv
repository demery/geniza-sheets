This appears to be a critique of a previous philological work, as is inferred (fol. 1 recto l. 9) וקד יגלט פי הדא אלפרק, in reference to the eighth chapter of the subject.;Other citations appear on this fol., of הדה אלי״ב, which may be referring to R. Sa'adia Gaon's Grammatical treatise of 12 chapters, Kutub al-Lugha, often referred to by this title (A. Dotan: Or rishon be-ḥokhmat ha-lashon / le-Rav Seàdyah Gaʾon ; Aron Dotan [ed.]. Jeruslaem, 1997 p. 30, Henry Malter, Jewish Quarterly Review  NS III (1912/1913),  p. 494). Unlike ibn Ḥayuj, who recorded the biphonetic letters בג״ד כפ״ת, our author lists בג״ד כפר״ת as in Sa'adiah Gaon on Sefer ha-yetsirah.;Much of the content of fol. 2 is on the additional meaning of the word אור that is omitted in the Maḥberet of Menaḥem ibn Saruḳ. Talmudic, as well as Biblical proof texts are listed. The essay ends after one third of the verso, signed תם אלכתאב בעון אלחרמן.;The remainder of fol. 2 verso is filled with five poetic riddles in Wafir meter, all of the same structure, attributed to Dunash ben Labrat, as in the heading לבן אלאבראט.
